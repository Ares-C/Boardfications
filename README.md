## What's Boardfications?

Boardfications is a Chrome extension (browser add-on) that manages your League of Legends Boards' notifications. It alerts you when you receive a new one, and allows you to delete them separately (something you can't do in the native boards' UI).
Using Boardfications is safe, because you don't need to authenticate, you just log into the forum and the extension will start working.
